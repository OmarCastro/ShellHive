<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to ShellHive GitHub Page.</h3>

<p>I am doing a dissertation, which objective is to simplify the creation and management of Unix Shell (SH) scripts, transforming the text script in a visual graph, which its focus is the processing of large amounts of data (in short, to do Big Data related tasks)
</p>

<p>
It also tries to simplify other things such as sharing and collaborating the graphs with other people, so that is easier to understand for people with high and low experience with SH scripts (such as trainees), it can also be used to teach other people how to write those scripts. 
</p>

<p>
I would like you to play with the demo to be show later, then to send me feedback by clicking on the "send feedback" link on the top bar, it will be a relatively short form. 
</p>

Thank you for for attention. </p>


<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>
